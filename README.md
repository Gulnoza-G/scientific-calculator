# Advanced Scientific Calculator

This project is an **Advanced Scientific Calculator** built using **React** and **math.js**. It provides a user-friendly interface for performing basic arithmetic, scientific calculations, graphing functions, and boolean logic operations. The calculator also supports switching between **degree and radian modes** for trigonometric functions.

## Features

1. **Basic Calculator**:
    - Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
    - Handles decimal numbers and parentheses.
    - Clear button to reset the display.
2. **Scientific Calculator**:
    - Supports trigonometric functions (`sin`, `cos`, `tan`), logarithms (`log`, `ln`), square roots (`√`), and constants (`π`, `e`).
    - Toggle between **degree and radian modes** for trigonometric calculations.
    - Handles exponents (`x^n`) and factorials (`!`).
3. **Graphing Calculator**:
    - Plots graphs of equations involving `x`.
    - Customizable `x` and `y` axis ranges.
    - Real-time graph updates.
4. **Boolean Logic Calculator**:
    - Performs boolean operations (`AND`, `OR`, `XOR`, `NAND`, `NOR`, `XNOR`) on binary inputs (`0` or `1`).
5. **Error Handling**:
    - Displays errors for invalid inputs or calculations.
    - Automatically resets after displaying an error.

1. **React State Management**:
    - Using `useState` to manage component state.
    - Handling user input and updating the UI dynamically.
2. **Mathematical Calculations**:
    - Using `math.js` for safe and accurate expression evaluation.
    - Implementing trigonometric functions with degree/radian support.
3. **Graphing**:
    - Using `recharts` to plot mathematical functions.
    - Dynamically updating graphs based on user input.
4. **Boolean Logic**:
    - Implementing boolean operations and validating binary inputs.
5. **Error Handling**:
    - Displaying and resetting errors gracefully.
6. **Component-Based Design**:
    - Breaking down the application into reusable components (e.g., tabs, buttons, inputs).

## Why This Code Matters

1. **Practical Application**:
    - This calculator is a real-world tool that can be used for educational, scientific, and engineering purposes.
2. **Learning Opportunity**:
    - It demonstrates how to build a complex application using modern web technologies.
    - It covers a wide range of concepts, from basic arithmetic to advanced graphing.
3. **Extensibility**:
    - The modular design makes it easy to add new features (e.g., unit conversions, statistical functions).
4. **Safe Evaluation**:
    - By using `math.js`, the calculator avoids the security risks associated with `eval` or the `Function` constructor.
5. **User-Friendly Interface**:
    - The tabbed interface and clear design make it accessible to users of all skill levels.
